<p>I just moved this blog to a more simpler, faster, more customizable and a reliable blogging platform! Octopress &hellip; Its built on <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> which use <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> to create a simple blogging framework that work with <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>. You write posts and customize the site on your own machine. Then you generate static HTML files using the Octopress framework and push them to your web host. Any simple host will do! You can even get free hosting on Github! How cool is that?</p>

<p>I used Wordpress since 2009. Currently, its the most widely used blogging platform in the world. Its full of features. You can use plugins to add more additional features. But, sometimes, you can get lost with these features. Too much of everything is good for nothing. Wordpress is not simple. Now its very complex. There are a lot of features that I don&rsquo;t need. But I can&rsquo;t remove them and they keep slowing down my site. Wordpress is a dynamic website. When a person visit your website, the server will execute php scripts to generate the website and then give it to the user. We can use caching plugins to reduce the server load but still it can get slow! Normally, Wordpress websites need more resources from the server. You constantly need to upgrade your server in order to keep the blog alive.</p>

<h3>How Octopress work?</h3>

<p>As I said earlier, Octopress runs on your own machine. Not in the web server. You need to setup the site, customize it and write the posts in your machine. To write posts, you just have to place a Markdown file in the <strong>_posts</strong> folder with the content of the post. After you are done, you have to issue two commands. <code>rake generate</code> will use the customizations you added, the settings, the plugins, the layouts, the posts and pages you added and build the whole site with static HTML files in a separate folder. That folder doesn&rsquo;t have any serverside language. Next, <code>rake deploy</code> will send the website to a remote server. If you use Git, it will automatically prepare separate branches that you can deploy and push to the right server. The server will have a static website which will be extremely fast! If you want, you can even preview a live version of the blog on your own machine before pushin with <code>rake preview</code></p>

<h3>Octopress doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of complicated features but you can add them&hellip;</h3>

<p>Octopress doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of complicated features. But its higly customizable and you can add the features you need. The source files are easy to understand. Doesn&rsquo;t have complicated php scripts like in Wordpress. Have some ruby bits but not too much.</p>

<h3>Its easy to customize&hellip;</h3>

<p>You have the source for the website on your local machine. No need to edit files and upload to test them like many people do in Wordpress. You can run a live preview on your own machine and deploy it to the real web server only when its ready.</p>

<h3>Octopress is really fast&hellip;</h3>

<p>Its extremely fast. Because there is nothing to generate dynamically, the server doesn&rsquo;t get a big load like in Wordpress. The server just have to serve the HTML files to the user.</p>

<h3>Its easy to find a good host and Github will host your site for free!</h3>

<p>A simple basic host will be enough to host an Octopress website. Every basic webserver have the ability to serve HTML files. So, you don&rsquo;t have to pay large amounts. If you are ok with open sourcing your site, then you can use Github to host your website! Its completely free and highly reliable!</p>

<h3>You don&rsquo;t need to keep backups and its really easy to migrate to a new host&hellip;</h3>

<p>You have the website on your local machine. You only generate and push the HTML files to the server. If you go to a new web server, you just have to push them again to the new address. No need to setup databases and run installation scripts. You also don&rsquo;t need to keep backups because you already have everything on your machine. If you use Git, you can push everything to Github or Bitbucket.</p>

<p>Some people move to Octopress because they love to blog in Markdown. I have only used Markdown to write readme files of several projects. I moved to Octopress because its fast, customizable and simple. Still there are some websites which need dynamic stuff. But a normal blog won&rsquo;t need them. So, I think I can use it for You Are Curious. Octopress is a bit geeky. They say its for hackers. But normal people who have some brains can figure it out. Im already a Rails developer and its not hard for me.</p>

<h3>Will I Move <a href="http://techhamlet.com/">Tech Hamlet</a> to Octopress?</h3>

<p>That might not happen. TH is a heavy site and its not easy to convert everything to Octopress. I might develop my own blogging platform with <a href="http://techhamlet.com/2013/05/install-ruby-on-rails-in-ubuntu/">Rails</a> or something better for TH. If I do that, I will open source it and let everyone use it. It will be something big! You&rsquo;ll love it! So for now, just try <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> and see whether you can get used to it!</p>

<p>The Internet is one of the greatest innovations that changed the world. It completely changed us. It have brought us closer. It have made our lives easier. It have brought almost all the knowledge in the world to our desk tops. It is really great. But, it also have a dark side&hellip; The Internet is Evil !</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>There are many great things that we use every day. We use them because they are useful to us. They help us. But remember, you can use the knife to prepare food and maintain your life&hellip; You can also use the same knife to end a life. Like that, the Internet also have a bad side. If you use it in the wrong way, for you, the Internet is Evil!</p>

<h3>You use the Internet to waste your time!</h3>

<p>Many people around the world use Facebook and other social networks every day. They go there, chat, poke, send messages, share photos, etc, etc, etc&hellip; There are some crazy people who share every single thing they do in their lives on social networks. They share what they eat, when they eat, a photo of their lunch, where they go, what they do, what they think&hellip; Actually this is a big disease. A fatal disease which is even more dangerous than AIDS. After doing all these stuff, we won&rsquo;t have any time left to do other stuff. Parents ignore their children.. Children ignore their schoolwork&hellip; Workers ignore their work&hellip; Several years ago, I went for a job training. One day, the company hired a young man who seems to have some good talents. Unfortunately, he is a Facebook addict. He doesn&rsquo;t do his work in time&hellip; He always do a lot of mistakes&hellip; Every thing he do have a mistake&hellip; For him, Internet is Evil! Later the company decided to block Internet access to him. After several months, the guy resigned and took revenge by taking another worker with him and by hacking the company&rsquo;s email account! Cool isn&rsquo;t it? This is one situation where we can think that the Internet is Evil!</p>

<h3>The Internet is damaging your security! You have no privacy&hellip; Its like standing naked in the middle of a big crowd!</h3>

<p>Do we really have to share every thing? If you have enemies, they can easily look at your Facebook profile and determine exactly how to bring you down. A thief can determine exactly when you leave your house and jump in. These stuff are true&hellip; Not just theories&hellip; These stuff happen. Because of this, once our local government issued warnings to the public not to share every thing online. Don&rsquo;t be foolish&hellip; The Internet is Evil!</p>

<p>Most of the big companies like Facebook and Google know a lot about you. They track your every move&hellip; You give them all your details&hellip; Do you think they will stay silent even when people like CIA and other big organizations offer money for your data? I don&rsquo;t think so. They publicly say that they share our information with their partners. Who are these partners? Can we trust them? Internet is Evil !</p>

<h3>Adults only sites make you brainless zombies!</h3>

<p>According to research, this is the biggest threat that face man kind. After getting addicted to online porn, people get completely transformed. They start to get exhausted. Life drains out of them. Their brains start to malfunction. These are scientifically proven. It make you feel guilt, shame, and humiliated&hellip; Internet is Evil !</p>

<blockquote><p>&mdash; Nearly all men who view pornography use it as the stimulus for masturbation. As a result they frequently suffer feelings of guilt, shame, regret and humiliation.</p>

<p>&mdash; Many men become addicted to pornography and lose their freedom. They feel trapped, out of control, and in despair. They literally become slaves to their own lust.</p>

<p>&mdash; Pornography places men on an emotional roller coaster. One minute they&rsquo;re happy, the next they&rsquo;re sad; calm, then angry; kind, then cold. These moods change without warning, causing stress and pain for wives, children, friends and associates. Feelings of estrangement ensue, further isolating and alienating them from their loved ones, which often drive men even deeper into the self-medicating escape of pornography.</p>

<p>&mdash; Men isolated on the slippery slope of pornography typically fail in their families and marriages, and in their relations with people in general. They are less effective, less reliable, less creative, and more prone to meanness and fits of anger. In essence, pornography turns men into zombie-like characters who are but a shadow of their true selves and potential. They waste their time, talents and resources, caught up in their own dark little world of pornography viewing.</p>

<p>&mdash; In the advanced stages, pornography addiction can lead a man to commit rape, incest, violence, exhibitionism, other sex-related crimes and even suicide. Millions of men have lost their families, their careers, their reputations, their good names, and their freedom just to satisfy their addiction.</p>

<p>&mdash; Pornography can take an immensely good, talented, enthusiastic man and turn him into one of the walking dead.</p>

<p><em> - <a href="http://www.netnanny.com/learn_center/article/153">Net Nanny</a></em></p></blockquote>

<p>Most people who are already addicted to these things might try to justify themselves. They might get extremely angry with me. But they will some day learn the truth. These things make you lose your humanity. The teenager don&rsquo;t know who is his parents&hellip; The workers don&rsquo;t know they have a job to do&hellip; Parents don&rsquo;t know they have children&hellip; Rape, Murder, Theft, Abuse and many more evil things rise because of these bad addictions. If you get to these things, you&rsquo;ll forget who you are. Trust me, the world will be a much better place if these pathetic psychos didn&rsquo;t start to show their stupidity by starting adult websites. It&rsquo;s a monster that take down our younger generation. There won&rsquo;t be anything left if we don&rsquo;t take an action now! The Internet is Evil!</p>

<h3>Too much information&hellip; You don&rsquo;t know what to believe and what not to believe&hellip;</h3>

<p>Internet is a source of vast amount of information. But, how can we know whether they are true or false? Some say that even Wikipedia have a lot of false facts because they allow anyone to edit their pages. There are a large number of news websites. One story can be interpreted in many different ways in each website. How can we trust them? The truth is&hellip; We can&rsquo;t! The Internet is Evil!</p>

<h3>Its damaging your long-term memory&hellip; It make you think like another computer!</h3>

<p>Normally, humans can&rsquo;t store something on their brains in an instant. It takes time for the information that enter our mind to settle in. But the Internet can make us distracted. That will prevent information from getting into our long-term memory. You can&rsquo;t always rely on Google to search things. What if Google goes down? What if you go somewhere which doesn&rsquo;t have Internet? What if you get lost in the wild? Can you use the internet to watch Man vs Wild and learn how to survive? I don&rsquo;t think so&hellip;</p>

<h3>Internet is Evil !!!</h3>

<p>Face it&hellip; The Internet that you use every day is Evil! Most of you don&rsquo;t want to believe it but that's the truth. I only mentioned a small amount of facts that make it evil. There are a lot more. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s completely bad. It have a lot of uses. If used correctly, it can become a really useful companion to us. But the harsh truth is, most of the stupid people use it to ruin their lives! Its time to think! The Internet is Evil !</p>
