<p>If you have read my <a href="http://youarecurio.us/2013/05/ancient-people-used-electricity/">previous post</a>, you might have seen how our ancestors managed to do great things&hellip; Things we still can&rsquo;t do! How did they do those things? Did they possess super brains? Nope&hellip; There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with them&hellip; The problem is with us! Intelligence vs knowledge!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Our ancestors built great monuments, invented stuff, predicted the future, and did many more things which we still can&rsquo;t understand. In some societies, there are certain myths. Don&rsquo;t do this&hellip; It will make the gods angry&hellip; Don&rsquo;t do that&hellip; It will bring bad luck. But if we look carefully, there is a scientific reason to say no to it. Of-course there are some myths among them. Did they use scientific research and knowledge taken from loads of books? They did use some knowledge but they were intelligent enough to find that knowledge by themselves and apply them. But we only rely on knowledge! Isn&rsquo;t that true? First we need to understand the difference between these two&hellip; Intelligence vs Knowledge!</p>

<h3>What is Knowledge?</h3>

<p>In the present day, our education system force us to study&hellip; By heart everything and put them down in the exam paper. So, most of the people who get high marks for their exams have a lot of knowledge. They have stacked up a lot of stuff inside their memory. But do they know how to use that knowledge? Do they know whether the facts they have learnt are true or false? Most of them don&rsquo;t! Most of them don&rsquo;t know how to use their knowledge&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know about others but in our country, many people who get a degree won&rsquo;t get a good job. So, they riot asking the government to give them a job. But people who doesn&rsquo;t even have a degree get top jobs! The reason? People don&rsquo;t know how to use their vast knowledge and they are not practical.</p>

<p>During the World War, Japan possessed the most powerful and the <a href="http://youarecurio.us/2013/04/yamato-largest-battleship/">largest battleship</a>. They also possessed the most innovative and the largest submarine. But both of them were never put into real use. They were not practical. Not suitable for the ongoing war. Its just like the Intelligence vs Knowledge war!</p>

<p>If you fill your head with too much knowledge, you might lose the capacity needed to process them. You have a budge of $500 (It&rsquo;s only an example&hellip;). You need to buy a computer. You spend 70% of that money and buy a 2TB hard drive. Then with the remainder, you buy the rest of the components with an old Pentium 3 processor. You can fill the hard drive with knowledge. But can you process them in time? Who will win the Intelligence vs Knowledge battle?</p>

<h3>What is Intelligence?</h3>

<p>You don&rsquo;t have to rely on books and findings of early scientists. You don&rsquo;t have to rely on Sir Isaac Newton to learn about the gravity. Humans know that. Human mind know every secret in this universe. We just need to be intelligent enough to find it. If we clear out our minds, the answers become clear. Even a poor child who haven&rsquo;t gone to school know that everything tossed up, comes down. Isn&rsquo;t that knowledge enough for our work? Do we really need to know who discovered it, how, what is his occupation, the name of his wife&hellip; Do we? If I&rsquo;m wrong, how did our ancient people build such great monuments? How did they made the necessary calculations? Our ancestors predict the future using astrology. It&rsquo;s not guess-work&hellip; Its maths. But it won&rsquo;t be true all the time. How did they do all these stuff without the computers? Simple.. They used the most powerful computer on this universe.. The human mind! Great scientists like Sir Isaac Newton made great discoveries by their own because they were intelligent. Not with vast amounts of knowledge. They were intelligent enough to think. Who will win the Intelligence vs Knowledge battle?</p>

<h3>What is wrong with us?</h3>

<p>Intelligence vs Knowledge! Our ancient people relied on their own findings&hellip; On their own minds&hellip; But today, we rely on some one else&rsquo;s findings. We don&rsquo;t know whether those findings are true or false. We use computers to aid us. We think we are superior to our ancestors. Is it right? There are some great findings and creations made by our ancestors that we still can&rsquo;t do with all this technology. Admit it&hellip; They were more superior than us! Most of us just fill our heads with knowledge. It saves energy and time. Then waste the rest of our energy for fun (for clubbing, drinking, partying)&hellip; Fun&hellip; not for happiness! They all end with sad faces :(</p>

<h3>Intelligence vs Knowledge : What shall we do?</h3>

<p>We need to balance things out. We need to have some knowledge to start. Then use your intelligence to figure out the rest. Only take what you really want. Dump everything else from your mind. Figure out the rest. Its not that hard&hellip; You don&rsquo;t have to spend hours studying! You get the answers you want in an instant after your mind gets used to figuring things out on its own. Don&rsquo;t think your mind is dumb. Its more intelligent than you are. It know everything. Just let it teach you! In the war between Intelligence vs Knowledge, intelligence wins!</p>
