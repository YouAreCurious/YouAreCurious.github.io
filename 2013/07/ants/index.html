<div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/post-images/2013/07/ants.jpg" title="Ants" alt="Ants" /></p>

<p>Ants&hellip; They are small, live in large numbers, steal our food, bite us hard if we try to disturb them, and its extremely hard to get rid of them! That&rsquo;s all most of us know about these tiny insects. Do you know what&rsquo;s really going on inside their secret underground homes? How they build them? How large they are? How they live? How they find food? How they behave?</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>The Ant colony is bigger than you think!</h2>

<p>You might have seen small openings in the ground which are doorways into the ant colony. But out of our plain sight, Ants build their colonies around a large area. Some colonies can stretch up to several kilometers! Impressive isn&rsquo;t it? We will see several Ant holes in the ground. We think it belong to several colonies. But there might be only one large nest.</p>

<h2>All the ant in the colony have only one mother</h2>

<p>In an Ant colony, there&rsquo;s a Queen. Unlike a human Queens, an Ant Queen won&rsquo;t control the colony. Her only job is to produce Ants! Once a year, a Queen will produce several other queens which will fly away and find more colonies. After finding a new colony, she will keep producing up to 1,500 eggs per day! (It varies from different ant species). She won&rsquo;t move. So the worker Ants keep feeding her, disposing her waste and protecting her. She is the mother of all the Ants in the colony! A Queen can live upto nearly 28 years.</p>

<h2>Almost all Ants are females</h2>

<p>Yes its true&hellip; All the Ants in the colony are females! It makes sense&hellip; Only the Queen produce babies. All the others work or defend the colony. The Queen will produce males only once a year when she is producing more Queens to find more colonies.</p>

<h2>The Queen is not in control&hellip; The workers are!</h2>

<p>The Queen is not really a Queen. When it come to Ants, the workers are the true Queens. They control everything including who become workers and who become soldiers. All the eggs that the Queen produce are the same. The workers can turn them into soldiers and different type of workers according to the amount of food they give. If there&rsquo;s a threat to the colony, they will produce more soldiers.</p>

<h2>The Ants are Farmers!</h2>

<p>We think that Ants eat everything that they take. But some Ants cultivate fungus inside their colonies. A group of Ants collect leaves, another group chew them and another group stick them to the fungus garden. They build them carefully. The fungus gardens are built to contain small cavities that they use to place the eggs. Some ants can even detect harmful leaves that can harm the fungus and stay away from them. The Ants feed on a byproduct of the fungus called gongylidia.</p>

<h2>They use a chemical named pheromones to communicate</h2>

<p>First an Ant go out to find food. It use pheromones to mark its track. If it find food, it will come back that path and add more pheromones to make the scent even stronger. If it can&rsquo;t find food in that path, it won&rsquo;t produce anymore pheromones and the existing trail will soon evaporate. They also produce pheromones at a time of danger. More pheromones will attract more guards to the scene!</p>

<h2>Ants actually talk!</h2>

<p>They are very small and their frequency is way beyond our audible range&hellip; So we can&rsquo;t hear them. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that they can&rsquo;t talk. For example, if an Ant find a spot with more delicious food, it will shout out and tell its colleagues to come to that specific area. If an Ant gets into trouble, then also it will shout out and call for help!</p>

<h2>Their colony is very well guarded&hellip;</h2>

<p>The Ant guards patrol the colony from time to time. Each and every guard have its own area to patrol. But several guards cross the Queen&rsquo;s chamber many times making it a high security zone!</p>

<h2>The power of the Ant colony is unimaginable&hellip;</h2>

<p>In the Amazon, there are frequent floods. We think that during a flood, all the Ants in the ground will die. Wrong&hellip; Several researches have tracked an Ant colony during a flood. All the Ants will join together and form a raft that floats on water. The Ants in the bottom won&rsquo;t drown because they have a small air bubble around their heads. A group of Ants constantly move around and feed the Ants that have formed the raft. They also keep organizing the eggs and the Queen to protect them from any oncoming threats. They have food in this raft and can survive for months until they meet dry land!</p>

<p>If you ever disturb an Ant nest, they will go in search of an alternative place. If some one find it, it will come back and bring another mate to get a second opinion. Then they will gradually move in. Sometimes, when they make this move, the guardian Ants will join together and form a wall around the path for protection. It&rsquo;s truly amazing&hellip;</p>

<h2>Ants always keep their nests clean</h2>

<p>Below every Ant nest, there is a garbage dump. All the garbage including dead Ants will end up in this dump. They doesn&rsquo;t keep any garbage inside their colony. They keep them clean.</p>

<h2>Ants might be more intelligent than us!</h2>

<p>Humans doesn&rsquo;t use all the neurons in their brains. They use only a very small percentage of it. But Ants use most of their brains. They are intelligent but unlike humans, they doesn&rsquo;t want to go beyond the rules of the nature. But we does, that&rsquo;s why we need to invent things and find new stuff in order to survive! Ants live but we survive! (If you are wise enough you&rsquo;ll understand my hint)</p>

<p>I have only mentioned few amazing facts about these marvelous creatures. Most of us think of them as irrelevant pests. But according to recent studies, they can change a whole ecosystem! Enzymes coming from their nests can give birth to various kinds of plants. They are small. But they are one of the most amazing creatures on this planet! Until today you thought they were irrelevant. But now you know their true power. <a href="http://eepurl.com/yH0mv">Stay with me</a> and I will bring you more amazing facts like this in the future!</p>
