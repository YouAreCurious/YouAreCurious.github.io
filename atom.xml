<p>If you need to become extremely productive, if you need to spend a perfect life, if you need to be able to reach your goals without any issues, if you really need to make tour life a big success then you should put the things I&rsquo;m going to say today into your thick skull! The title I used is a verse taken from the film Kungfu Panda. This is a very old saying used by our ancients! It have a very deep meaning which can help you to change your whole life!</p>

<h2>The big problem&hellip;</h2>

<p>Most of us spend a lot of time thinking about our past and the future. We keep recalling the past, we keep planning for the future. But does we give much time for our present? The simple answer is NO! What we do now becomes the past&hellip; Our future reach us and become the present. But we doesn&rsquo;t give much time for the present!!! <strong>Its the most important part in time!</strong></p>

<h2>Yesterday is a History&hellip;</h2>

<p>We spend a lot of time thinking about our past. We are worried about our past mistakes. We are delighted and keep recalling our past achievements. But what you don&rsquo;t know is, the past the past&hellip; You can&rsquo;t change it&hellip; Its gone&hellip; Over&hellip; Won&rsquo;t come again!!! So, there&rsquo;s no point to spend so much time thinking about it!</p>

<h3>We should learn from the past&hellip; Not bring it to the present&hellip;</h3>

<p>Don&rsquo;t bring the whole past to the present. Learn from your past mistakes&hellip; <strong>Don&rsquo;t do the same mistake again!</strong> Forget about the past doesn&rsquo;t mean you can commit a crime and then forget about it. You have to pay for what you did either by law, or by nature or by your own conscious! So, don&rsquo;t do anything that haunt you for your life! Learn from those mistakes. Never do them again. Learn from the past achievements. Remember how you got them. Apply those theories to your present work. But, you should not keep recalling these things. Just load the necessary information only when you need it. A computer program always try to load only the specific set of data it need to do that specific work. If not, it will be a waste of resources! Just like in computers, we also waste our time and energy by thinking about unnecessary stuff! <strong>Trust me, thinking will drain a very large part of your energy.</strong> Most of you might have already experienced this! Some might even get depressed by thinking about their past&hellip; It&rsquo;s a serious problem!</p>

<h2>Tomorrow is a Mystery!</h2>

<p>Unless some crazy genius build a time machine, you have no way of learning what will happen in the future. There are ways to look to the future through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation">meditation</a> (Remember this&hellip; Our mind do time travelling everyday and we don&rsquo;t know about it!)  But I don&rsquo;t think you and I have such a power. You don&rsquo;t know what will happen in the future. No one can tell that he can&rsquo;t die in the next second. No one can do it. The world is highly unpredictable. So, how on earth can we plan for our future? Now please do not misunderstand me&hellip; It&rsquo;s OK to set goals in your life. But extensive planning is not good! Once I had a friend who had some big goals. He told me that by 2015 (I can&rsquo;t remember the exact year), he is planning to lead the world&rsquo;s greatest IT company and earn big time. He even gave an approximate amount of US dollars he want to earn. Is he nuts??? How can we plan like that? For him, its one thing he always follow. If he doesn&rsquo;t reach this goal, he might even have a heart attack! At that time, he was unable to even reach short goals that he set. He wanted to run some start-ups but failed!</p>

<h2>Today is a Gift! That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s called the Present!</h2>

<p>No matter what happened in the past, no matter what&rsquo;s there in store for you in the future, now you are in the present! No one have invented a time machine yet so you have to live in the present! If you always think about the past while living in the present, <strong>then you are a broken fool</strong>. If you always think about the future while living in the present, <strong>then you are just a dreamer.</strong></p>

<p><strong>You have to live in the present.</strong> That&rsquo;s the key for your success. You won&rsquo;t have a future if you doesn&rsquo;t do the right thing in the present. You won&rsquo;t have a past that you can smile on if you doesn&rsquo;t do the right thing now. Your whole life will be shaped according to what you do now. It&rsquo;s the root of everything. But many people forget this root. Its like trying to get on to the 100th step in the staircase without getting on to the first one. Its impossible!</p>

<h2>What should we do?</h2>

<blockquote><p>Yesterday is a History, Tomorrow is a Mystery and Today is a Gift! Thats why its called Present!</p></blockquote>

<h3>Learn from the past&hellip;</h3>

<p><strong>Learn from your past.</strong> When ever you are doing the same thing again, use the past experience to do it better this time. Never do the same mistake twice! But do not waste your time thinking (recalling) the past!</p>

<h3>Set goals for the future&hellip;</h3>

<p><strong>Not having a proper goal is dumb.</strong> Its like just walking on the road without having a destination. You need to set some basic goals. But not crazy one like &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have a 2 million dollar salary by the end of 2016!&rdquo; That&rsquo;s completely insane! People will think you are a fool!</p>

<h3>Do what you have to do correctly and in the right way now&hellip;</h3>

<p>Think what you have to do now and complete those tasks. Do not waste time planning for tomorrow or for next hour. Do it now. Sometimes, you might finish the work you are supposed to do tomorrow and get a vacation! If you move on like this with your goal in your head, <strong>you will definitely WIN!</strong> If you keep planning for the future and keep thinking about the past, you won&rsquo;t achieve anything! <strong>You will FAIL!</strong> I hope you understood my post. Hope it will make you more productive! If you want more productivity tips like this, please <a href="http://eepurl.com/yH0mv">stay in touch</a>!</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[11 Facts About Ants that Will Make You Worship Them! (Plus a Video)]]></title>
    <link href="http://YouAreCurious.github.io/2013/07/ants/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://YouAreCurious.github.io/images/post-images/2013/07/ants.jpg" title="Ants" alt="Ants" /></p>

<p>Ants&hellip; They are small, live in large numbers, steal our food, bite us hard if we try to disturb them, and its extremely hard to get rid of them! That&rsquo;s all most of us know about these tiny insects. Do you know what&rsquo;s really going on inside their secret underground homes? How they build them? How large they are? How they live? How they find food? How they behave?</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>The Ant colony is bigger than you think!</h2>

<p>You might have seen small openings in the ground which are doorways into the ant colony. But out of our plain sight, Ants build their colonies around a large area. Some colonies can stretch up to several kilometers! Impressive isn&rsquo;t it? We will see several Ant holes in the ground. We think it belong to several colonies. But there might be only one large nest.</p>

<h2>All the ant in the colony have only one mother</h2>

<p>In an Ant colony, there&rsquo;s a Queen. Unlike a human Queens, an Ant Queen won&rsquo;t control the colony. Her only job is to produce Ants! Once a year, a Queen will produce several other queens which will fly away and find more colonies. After finding a new colony, she will keep producing up to 1,500 eggs per day! (It varies from different ant species). She won&rsquo;t move. So the worker Ants keep feeding her, disposing her waste and protecting her. She is the mother of all the Ants in the colony! A Queen can live upto nearly 28 years.</p>

<h2>Almost all Ants are females</h2>

<p>Yes its true&hellip; All the Ants in the colony are females! It makes sense&hellip; Only the Queen produce babies. All the others work or defend the colony. The Queen will produce males only once a year when she is producing more Queens to find more colonies.</p>

<h2>The Queen is not in control&hellip; The workers are!</h2>

<p>The Queen is not really a Queen. When it come to Ants, the workers are the true Queens. They control everything including who become workers and who become soldiers. All the eggs that the Queen produce are the same. The workers can turn them into soldiers and different type of workers according to the amount of food they give. If there&rsquo;s a threat to the colony, they will produce more soldiers.</p>

<h2>The Ants are Farmers!</h2>

<p>We think that Ants eat everything that they take. But some Ants cultivate fungus inside their colonies. A group of Ants collect leaves, another group chew them and another group stick them to the fungus garden. They build them carefully. The fungus gardens are built to contain small cavities that they use to place the eggs. Some ants can even detect harmful leaves that can harm the fungus and stay away from them. The Ants feed on a byproduct of the fungus called gongylidia.</p>

<h2>They use a chemical named pheromones to communicate</h2>

<p>First an Ant go out to find food. It use pheromones to mark its track. If it find food, it will come back that path and add more pheromones to make the scent even stronger. If it can&rsquo;t find food in that path, it won&rsquo;t produce anymore pheromones and the existing trail will soon evaporate. They also produce pheromones at a time of danger. More pheromones will attract more guards to the scene!</p>

<h2>Ants actually talk!</h2>

<p>They are very small and their frequency is way beyond our audible range&hellip; So we can&rsquo;t hear them. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that they can&rsquo;t talk. For example, if an Ant find a spot with more delicious food, it will shout out and tell its colleagues to come to that specific area. If an Ant gets into trouble, then also it will shout out and call for help!</p>

<h2>Their colony is very well guarded&hellip;</h2>

<p>The Ant guards patrol the colony from time to time. Each and every guard have its own area to patrol. But several guards cross the Queen&rsquo;s chamber many times making it a high security zone!</p>

<h2>The power of the Ant colony is unimaginable&hellip;</h2>

<p>In the Amazon, there are frequent floods. We think that during a flood, all the Ants in the ground will die. Wrong&hellip; Several researches have tracked an Ant colony during a flood. All the Ants will join together and form a raft that floats on water. The Ants in the bottom won&rsquo;t drown because they have a small air bubble around their heads. A group of Ants constantly move around and feed the Ants that have formed the raft. They also keep organizing the eggs and the Queen to protect them from any oncoming threats. They have food in this raft and can survive for months until they meet dry land!</p>

<p>If you ever disturb an Ant nest, they will go in search of an alternative place. If some one find it, it will come back and bring another mate to get a second opinion. Then they will gradually move in. Sometimes, when they make this move, the guardian Ants will join together and form a wall around the path for protection. It&rsquo;s truly amazing&hellip;</p>

<h2>Ants always keep their nests clean</h2>

<p>Below every Ant nest, there is a garbage dump. All the garbage including dead Ants will end up in this dump. They doesn&rsquo;t keep any garbage inside their colony. They keep them clean.</p>

<h2>Ants might be more intelligent than us!</h2>

<p>Humans doesn&rsquo;t use all the neurons in their brains. They use only a very small percentage of it. But Ants use most of their brains. They are intelligent but unlike humans, they doesn&rsquo;t want to go beyond the rules of the nature. But we does, that&rsquo;s why we need to invent things and find new stuff in order to survive! Ants live but we survive! (If you are wise enough you&rsquo;ll understand my hint)</p>

<p>I have only mentioned few amazing facts about these marvelous creatures. Most of us think of them as irrelevant pests. But according to recent studies, they can change a whole ecosystem! Enzymes coming from their nests can give birth to various kinds of plants. They are small. But they are one of the most amazing creatures on this planet! Until today you thought they were irrelevant. But now you know their true power. <a href="http://eepurl.com/yH0mv">Stay with me</a> and I will bring you more amazing facts like this in the future!</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Things You Don't Know About Hitler]]></title>
    <link href="http://YouAreCurious.github.io/2013/06/hitler/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-18T20:59:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://YouAreCurious.github.io/2013/06/hitler</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://YouAreCurious.github.io/images/post-images/2013/06/hitler.jpg" title="Hitler" alt="Hitler" /></p>

<p>Before starting to study history, I knew very little about Hitler. I knew him as the vicious savage man who killed millions of people! Why did he started the war? Is it just because he is mad? He said he and the other pure Germans are the most superior race on this planet! Is it true? Lets find out&hellip;</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>Hitler is not a German and his race is unknown!</h3>

<p>This will be a real blow to most of you. Yes&hellip; Its true&hellip; Hitler is not a German! He was born in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria">Austria</a>. Very close to the German border. Hitler killed because of a racial problem. He wanted to eliminate the Jews. But Hitler&rsquo;s own race is unknown. No one know whether he belong to a good race or to Jews. It was a very closely guarded secret!</p>

<h3>Why did he started the war?</h3>

<p>First, Hitler was just a courier for the German army. During the 1<sup>st</sup> World War, he saw the carnage first hand. The Allies hit Germany very hard. In this hard time, the Jews have refused to help them! The role played by the Jews is a bit unclear at this moment. Some say they were innocent and some say they are the cause. People say that, because Jews doesn&rsquo;t have their own country, they lived in other nations. But they were not patriotic. They never help the country they live in. If you check the history, many wars started due to these Jews. Its still unclear to me why they are so hated. Hitler also hated them for not supporting his country. So he thought of getting rid of them!</p>

<p>After the World War I, the Allies enforced harsh rules against Germany. The country became one of the poorest nations on earth. Hitler wanted to change this. World War I completely changed him. Actually, the World War I created Hitler! If the records are correct, he fought for his own people! To save his own nation. But he did it the wrong way.</p>

<h3>Hitler called himself an Aryan!</h3>

<p>Hitler said he belongs to the Aryan race. But the truth is, Aryans lived in India. Its a noble pure race. Lord Buddha is an Aryan. Lord Buddha later called people who follow his religion are Aryans. Not as a race, just a name. (But the Buddha completely denied the races. He told us that everyone is equal.). But now we know that even Hitler didn&rsquo;t knew his real race!</p>

<h3>Hitler said he and his followers belong to a superior race! Are they that superior?</h3>

<p>In here we should first note that before Hitler, Germany was a poor country which had a very small military force. Most of its military powers were removed after the 1<sup>st</sup> World War. Hitler somehow made this nation into one of the most powerful nations on earth! He did bring glory for his own people. Many mainstream technologies that we use today were invented by Hitler&rsquo;s scientists. His scientists invented the first jet engine. His scientists invented the first ballistic missile. His scientists cracked the secrets of nuclear energy! They are genius!</p>

<p>Hitler did a lot of stuff for his nation. But still, he did it in the wrong way. He killed millions of people without any hesitation. He was a brutal killer. The whole world know that. But I don&rsquo;t think most of you knew the stuff I talked today. There are more secrets in his life which need to be uncovered. I will surely let you know when I learn more about him. So, <a href="http://eepurl.com/yH0mv">stay in touch</a>!</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Moved from Wordpress to Octopress! Simple, Faster and More Reliable!]]></title>
    <link href="http://YouAreCurious.github.io/2013/06/wordpress-to-octopress/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-18T08:07:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://YouAreCurious.github.io/2013/06/wordpress-to-octopress</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://YouAreCurious.github.io/images/post-images/2013/06/octopress.jpg" title="Octopress" alt="Octopress" /></p>

<p>I just moved this blog to a more simpler, faster, more customizable and a reliable blogging platform! Octopress &hellip; Its built on <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> which use <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> to create a simple blogging framework that work with <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>. You write posts and customize the site on your own machine. Then you generate static HTML files using the Octopress framework and push them to your web host. Any simple host will do! You can even get free hosting on Github! How cool is that?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I used Wordpress since 2009. Currently, its the most widely used blogging platform in the world. Its full of features. You can use plugins to add more additional features. But, sometimes, you can get lost with these features. Too much of everything is good for nothing. Wordpress is not simple. Now its very complex. There are a lot of features that I don&rsquo;t need. But I can&rsquo;t remove them and they keep slowing down my site. Wordpress is a dynamic website. When a person visit your website, the server will execute php scripts to generate the website and then give it to the user. We can use caching plugins to reduce the server load but still it can get slow! Normally, Wordpress websites need more resources from the server. You constantly need to upgrade your server in order to keep the blog alive.</p>

<h3>How Octopress work?</h3>

<p>As I said earlier, Octopress runs on your own machine. Not in the web server. You need to setup the site, customize it and write the posts in your machine. To write posts, you just have to place a Markdown file in the <strong>_posts</strong> folder with the content of the post. After you are done, you have to issue two commands. <code>rake generate</code> will use the customizations you added, the settings, the plugins, the layouts, the posts and pages you added and build the whole site with static HTML files in a separate folder. That folder doesn&rsquo;t have any serverside language. Next, <code>rake deploy</code> will send the website to a remote server. If you use Git, it will automatically prepare separate branches that you can deploy and push to the right server. The server will have a static website which will be extremely fast! If you want, you can even preview a live version of the blog on your own machine before pushin with <code>rake preview</code></p>

<h3>Octopress doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of complicated features but you can add them&hellip;</h3>

<p>Octopress doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of complicated features. But its higly customizable and you can add the features you need. The source files are easy to understand. Doesn&rsquo;t have complicated php scripts like in Wordpress. Have some ruby bits but not too much.</p>

<h3>Its easy to customize&hellip;</h3>

<p>You have the source for the website on your local machine. No need to edit files and upload to test them like many people do in Wordpress. You can run a live preview on your own machine and deploy it to the real web server only when its ready.</p>

<h3>Octopress is really fast&hellip;</h3>

<p>Its extremely fast. Because there is nothing to generate dynamically, the server doesn&rsquo;t get a big load like in Wordpress. The server just have to serve the HTML files to the user.</p>

<h3>Its easy to find a good host and Github will host your site for free!</h3>

<p>A simple basic host will be enough to host an Octopress website. Every basic webserver have the ability to serve HTML files. So, you don&rsquo;t have to pay large amounts. If you are ok with open sourcing your site, then you can use Github to host your website! Its completely free and highly reliable!</p>

<h3>You don&rsquo;t need to keep backups and its really easy to migrate to a new host&hellip;</h3>

<p>You have the website on your local machine. You only generate and push the HTML files to the server. If you go to a new web server, you just have to push them again to the new address. No need to setup databases and run installation scripts. You also don&rsquo;t need to keep backups because you already have everything on your machine. If you use Git, you can push everything to Github or Bitbucket.</p>

<p>Some people move to Octopress because they love to blog in Markdown. I have only used Markdown to write readme files of several projects. I moved to Octopress because its fast, customizable and simple. Still there are some websites which need dynamic stuff. But a normal blog won&rsquo;t need them. So, I think I can use it for You Are Curious. Octopress is a bit geeky. They say its for hackers. But normal people who have some brains can figure it out. Im already a Rails developer and its not hard for me.</p>

<h3>Will I Move <a href="http://techhamlet.com/">Tech Hamlet</a> to Octopress?</h3>

<p>That might not happen. TH is a heavy site and its not easy to convert everything to Octopress. I might develop my own blogging platform with <a href="http://techhamlet.com/2013/05/install-ruby-on-rails-in-ubuntu/">Rails</a> or something better for TH. If I do that, I will open source it and let everyone use it. It will be something big! You&rsquo;ll love it! So for now, just try <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> and see whether you can get used to it!</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Internet is Evil : The Bad Side of The Internet! ]]></title>
    <link href="http://YouAreCurious.github.io/2013/05/internet-is-evil/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-17T18:49:27+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://YouAreCurious.github.io/2013/05/internet-is-evil</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://YouAreCurious.github.io/images/post-images/2013/05/evil-internet.jpg" title="Evil Internet" alt="Evil Internet" /></p>

<p>The Internet is one of the greatest innovations that changed the world. It completely changed us. It have brought us closer. It have made our lives easier. It have brought almost all the knowledge in the world to our desk tops. It is really great. But, it also have a dark side&hellip; The Internet is Evil !</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>There are many great things that we use every day. We use them because they are useful to us. They help us. But remember, you can use the knife to prepare food and maintain your life&hellip; You can also use the same knife to end a life. Like that, the Internet also have a bad side. If you use it in the wrong way, for you, the Internet is Evil!</p>

<h3>You use the Internet to waste your time!</h3>

<p>Many people around the world use Facebook and other social networks every day. They go there, chat, poke, send messages, share photos, etc, etc, etc&hellip; There are some crazy people who share every single thing they do in their lives on social networks. They share what they eat, when they eat, a photo of their lunch, where they go, what they do, what they think&hellip; Actually this is a big disease. A fatal disease which is even more dangerous than AIDS. After doing all these stuff, we won&rsquo;t have any time left to do other stuff. Parents ignore their children.. Children ignore their schoolwork&hellip; Workers ignore their work&hellip; Several years ago, I went for a job training. One day, the company hired a young man who seems to have some good talents. Unfortunately, he is a Facebook addict. He doesn&rsquo;t do his work in time&hellip; He always do a lot of mistakes&hellip; Every thing he do have a mistake&hellip; For him, Internet is Evil! Later the company decided to block Internet access to him. After several months, the guy resigned and took revenge by taking another worker with him and by hacking the company&rsquo;s email account! Cool isn&rsquo;t it? This is one situation where we can think that the Internet is Evil!</p>

<h3>The Internet is damaging your security! You have no privacy&hellip; Its like standing naked in the middle of a big crowd!</h3>

<p>Do we really have to share every thing? If you have enemies, they can easily look at your Facebook profile and determine exactly how to bring you down. A thief can determine exactly when you leave your house and jump in. These stuff are true&hellip; Not just theories&hellip; These stuff happen. Because of this, once our local government issued warnings to the public not to share every thing online. Don&rsquo;t be foolish&hellip; The Internet is Evil!</p>

<p>Most of the big companies like Facebook and Google know a lot about you. They track your every move&hellip; You give them all your details&hellip; Do you think they will stay silent even when people like CIA and other big organizations offer money for your data? I don&rsquo;t think so. They publicly say that they share our information with their partners. Who are these partners? Can we trust them? Internet is Evil !</p>

<h3>Adults only sites make you brainless zombies!</h3>

<p>According to research, this is the biggest threat that face man kind. After getting addicted to online porn, people get completely transformed. They start to get exhausted. Life drains out of them. Their brains start to malfunction. These are scientifically proven. It make you feel guilt, shame, and humiliated&hellip; Internet is Evil !</p>

<blockquote><p>&mdash; Nearly all men who view pornography use it as the stimulus for masturbation. As a result they frequently suffer feelings of guilt, shame, regret and humiliation.</p>

<p>&mdash; Many men become addicted to pornography and lose their freedom. They feel trapped, out of control, and in despair. They literally become slaves to their own lust.</p>

<p>&mdash; Pornography places men on an emotional roller coaster. One minute they&rsquo;re happy, the next they&rsquo;re sad; calm, then angry; kind, then cold. These moods change without warning, causing stress and pain for wives, children, friends and associates. Feelings of estrangement ensue, further isolating and alienating them from their loved ones, which often drive men even deeper into the self-medicating escape of pornography.</p>

<p>&mdash; Men isolated on the slippery slope of pornography typically fail in their families and marriages, and in their relations with people in general. They are less effective, less reliable, less creative, and more prone to meanness and fits of anger. In essence, pornography turns men into zombie-like characters who are but a shadow of their true selves and potential. They waste their time, talents and resources, caught up in their own dark little world of pornography viewing.</p>

<p>&mdash; In the advanced stages, pornography addiction can lead a man to commit rape, incest, violence, exhibitionism, other sex-related crimes and even suicide. Millions of men have lost their families, their careers, their reputations, their good names, and their freedom just to satisfy their addiction.</p>

<p>Most people who are already addicted to these things might try to justify themselves. They might get extremely angry with me. But they will some day learn the truth. These things make you lose your humanity. The teenager don&rsquo;t know who is his parents&hellip; The workers don&rsquo;t know they have a job to do&hellip; Parents don&rsquo;t know they have children&hellip; Rape, Murder, Theft, Abuse and many more evil things rise because of these bad addictions. If you get to these things, you&rsquo;ll forget who you are. Trust me, the world will be a much better place if these pathetic psychos didn&rsquo;t start to show their stupidity by starting adult websites. It&rsquo;s a monster that take down our younger generation. There won&rsquo;t be anything left if we don&rsquo;t take an action now! The Internet is Evil!</p>

<h3>Too much information&hellip; You don&rsquo;t know what to believe and what not to believe&hellip;</h3>

<p>Internet is a source of vast amount of information. But, how can we know whether they are true or false? Some say that even Wikipedia have a lot of false facts because they allow anyone to edit their pages. There are a large number of news websites. One story can be interpreted in many different ways in each website. How can we trust them? The truth is&hellip; We can&rsquo;t! The Internet is Evil!</p>

<h3>Its damaging your long-term memory&hellip; It make you think like another computer!</h3>

<p>Normally, humans can&rsquo;t store something on their brains in an instant. It takes time for the information that enter our mind to settle in. But the Internet can make us distracted. That will prevent information from getting into our long-term memory. You can&rsquo;t always rely on Google to search things. What if Google goes down? What if you go somewhere which doesn&rsquo;t have Internet? What if you get lost in the wild? Can you use the internet to watch Man vs Wild and learn how to survive? I don&rsquo;t think so&hellip;</p>

<h3>Internet is Evil !!!</h3>

<p>Face it&hellip; The Internet that you use every day is Evil! Most of you don&rsquo;t want to believe it but that&#8217;s the truth. I only mentioned a small amount of facts that make it evil. There are a lot more. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s completely bad. It have a lot of uses. If used correctly, it can become a really useful companion to us. But the harsh truth is, most of the stupid people use it to ruin their lives! Its time to think! The Internet is Evil !</p>

<p>Most of you might already know about the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill that shook the Gulf of Mexico. A series of human error have led to the destruction of the drilling rig with 11 lives. It didn&rsquo;t stop there&hellip; The crippled pipeline have discharged 4.9 million barrels of oil into the sea covering an area of 180,000 km2. The impact on the environment and on the health of coastal residents are huge. The damage is irreversible! Now we are going to look at what happened at the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill&hellip; What can we learn from it?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>First, watch this video and learn what happened, then we can discuss :</p>

<p><sub>This video belongs to <a href="http://natgeotv.com/uk/seconds-from-disaster/videos/deepwater-horizon">National Geographic Channel</a>. If you like it, please buy the series. </sub></p>

<h3></h3>

<h3>What can we learn from the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill?</h3>

<p>According to National Geographic, the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill is caused by human error! Deepwater Horizon is an oil drilling rig. It will drill holes leading to oil deposits. Then another rig will come and extract it. BP have leased this rig owned by Transocean to dig the deepest oil well in history. Already they were behind the schedule by nearly 40 days. So, they were in a hurry. It cost millions of dollars to run the rig for one day. So, they need to find a cheap way to finish the drill. Cost problems and Speed problems&hellip; The perfect recipe that can dissolve Safety! Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill is inevitable!</p>

<h3>They were in a hurry&hellip; They thought about money&hellip; Never do that!</h3>

<p>The operation have met some delays and now they are nearly 40 days behind the original schedule. That&rsquo;s a lot of time&hellip; They should have faced an immense pressure from the high officials to complete the job in time. If it&rsquo;s a job which doesn&rsquo;t have high safety threats, then its ok to apply pressure on the crew and get the job done in time. But now they are in the middle of the ocean&hellip; Drilling an oil well nearly 35,050 feet (nearly 10.6 kilometers) deep&hellip; Oil is highly flammable&hellip; They are sitting in a ticking time bomb. It can go off at any moment! At a time like this, safety should be the first priority. But, they risked their own safety to do the job fast and save some money!</p>

<p>Ask from yourself before taking such risks&hellip; Do you think money is more important than your life? The crew didn&rsquo;t understand this. So, 11 people had to pay with their lives. In a high risk situation like this, you should never ignore key safety measures. These people did it four times. They used a low quality cement to plug the well&hellip; They used only 6 centralizes instead of 21 because getting the extra 15 will eat more time&hellip; They didn&rsquo;t fix a flaw in the blow out preventer&hellip; They ignored the pressure readings to save time&hellip; The Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill is inevitable!</p>

<p>This is not the first occasion where time and money have brought disaster. Most of the plane crashes in the world occur due to these issues. That&rsquo;s an industry where safety is the top priority. But to save time and money, some pilots find shortcuts, some air lines find shortcuts for maintenance which leads to disaster! You should ever do that!</p>

<h3>The decision makers were not at the field&hellip; They only thought about money&hellip;</h3>

<p>Some of the decisions that triggered the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill were made by people several hundred kilometers away from the rig. They don&rsquo;t care about the safety because they are in a safe distant. They don&rsquo;t feel the full weight of the issues. While BP engineers recommended to use 21 centralizes, one of the BP&rsquo;s team leaders have ordered the crew to go with 6 because of time and money. How can they think about their time and money and risk some one else&rsquo;s life?</p>

<p>The crew at the rig refused to use the low quality cement. But BP, after using a partially complete test result ordered to use the low quality cement. The Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill is inevitable!</p>

<h3>Poor communication&hellip; The decision makers should know everything!</h3>

<p>BP gave the OK to use the low quality cement after the cementer Halliburton gave a partially complete report on the cement quality. They conducted several tests to determine whether the mix used in the rig can do the job. Only one test have passed while the others failed. But Halliburton gave only the report of the passed test to BP. Why didn&rsquo;t they gave all the reports? According to them, BP haven&rsquo;t told them about the exact situation in the rig.</p>

<p>If you are facing a critical situation like this, you should always open your mouth and give all the information to the decision makers. The decision makers should know every detail. Otherwise, they will make wrong decisions!</p>

<p>Time, Money, Poor selfish decisions and poor communication have curved the path to the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill. Ironically, the Deepwater Horizon rig had an excellent safety record. It took only several days to shatter its reputation!</p>

<p><strong>We fight a lot to earn money&hellip; We try to earn millions&hellip; Some people have several cars. But you can go only in one car at a time. We earn a lot&hellip; Think&hellip; What are our main goals? To eat and drink&hellip; Simply to stay alive! Why do we need millions to do it? Even though we earn a lot, there&rsquo;s a limit where we can spend them. But your life is invaluable. So, think twice before putting your or other&rsquo;s lives in risk for money!</strong></p>

    <link href="http://YouAreCurious.github.io/2013/05/intelligence-vs-knowledge/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-02T10:06:15+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://YouAreCurious.github.io/2013/05/intelligence-vs-knowledge</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://YouAreCurious.github.io/images/post-images/2013/05/intelligence-vs-knowledge.jpg" title="Intelligence vs Knowledge" alt="Intelligence vs Knowledge" /></p>

<p>If you have read my <a href="http://youarecurio.us/2013/05/ancient-people-used-electricity/">previous post</a>, you might have seen how our ancestors managed to do great things&hellip; Things we still can&rsquo;t do! How did they do those things? Did they possess super brains? Nope&hellip; There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with them&hellip; The problem is with us! Intelligence vs knowledge!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Our ancestors built great monuments, invented stuff, predicted the future, and did many more things which we still can&rsquo;t understand. In some societies, there are certain myths. Don&rsquo;t do this&hellip; It will make the gods angry&hellip; Don&rsquo;t do that&hellip; It will bring bad luck. But if we look carefully, there is a scientific reason to say no to it. Of-course there are some myths among them. Did they use scientific research and knowledge taken from loads of books? They did use some knowledge but they were intelligent enough to find that knowledge by themselves and apply them. But we only rely on knowledge! Isn&rsquo;t that true? First we need to understand the difference between these two&hellip; Intelligence vs Knowledge!</p>

<h3>What is Knowledge?</h3>

<p>In the present day, our education system force us to study&hellip; By heart everything and put them down in the exam paper. So, most of the people who get high marks for their exams have a lot of knowledge. They have stacked up a lot of stuff inside their memory. But do they know how to use that knowledge? Do they know whether the facts they have learnt are true or false? Most of them don&rsquo;t! Most of them don&rsquo;t know how to use their knowledge&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know about others but in our country, many people who get a degree won&rsquo;t get a good job. So, they riot asking the government to give them a job. But people who doesn&rsquo;t even have a degree get top jobs! The reason? People don&rsquo;t know how to use their vast knowledge and they are not practical.</p>

<p>During the World War, Japan possessed the most powerful and the <a href="http://youarecurio.us/2013/04/yamato-largest-battleship/">largest battleship</a>. They also possessed the most innovative and the largest submarine. But both of them were never put into real use. They were not practical. Not suitable for the ongoing war. Its just like the Intelligence vs Knowledge war!</p>

<p>If you fill your head with too much knowledge, you might lose the capacity needed to process them. You have a budge of $500 (It&rsquo;s only an example&hellip;). You need to buy a computer. You spend 70% of that money and buy a 2TB hard drive. Then with the remainder, you buy the rest of the components with an old Pentium 3 processor. You can fill the hard drive with knowledge. But can you process them in time? Who will win the Intelligence vs Knowledge battle?</p>

<h3>What is Intelligence?</h3>

<p>You don&rsquo;t have to rely on books and findings of early scientists. You don&rsquo;t have to rely on Sir Isaac Newton to learn about the gravity. Humans know that. Human mind know every secret in this universe. We just need to be intelligent enough to find it. If we clear out our minds, the answers become clear. Even a poor child who haven&rsquo;t gone to school know that everything tossed up, comes down. Isn&rsquo;t that knowledge enough for our work? Do we really need to know who discovered it, how, what is his occupation, the name of his wife&hellip; Do we? If I&rsquo;m wrong, how did our ancient people build such great monuments? How did they made the necessary calculations? Our ancestors predict the future using astrology. It&rsquo;s not guess-work&hellip; Its maths. But it won&rsquo;t be true all the time. How did they do all these stuff without the computers? Simple.. They used the most powerful computer on this universe.. The human mind! Great scientists like Sir Isaac Newton made great discoveries by their own because they were intelligent. Not with vast amounts of knowledge. They were intelligent enough to think. Who will win the Intelligence vs Knowledge battle?</p>

<h3>What is wrong with us?</h3>

<p>Intelligence vs Knowledge! Our ancient people relied on their own findings&hellip; On their own minds&hellip; But today, we rely on some one else&rsquo;s findings. We don&rsquo;t know whether those findings are true or false. We use computers to aid us. We think we are superior to our ancestors. Is it right? There are some great findings and creations made by our ancestors that we still can&rsquo;t do with all this technology. Admit it&hellip; They were more superior than us! Most of us just fill our heads with knowledge. It saves energy and time. Then waste the rest of our energy for fun (for clubbing, drinking, partying)&hellip; Fun&hellip; not for happiness! They all end with sad faces :(</p>

<h3>Intelligence vs Knowledge : What shall we do?</h3>

<p>We need to balance things out. We need to have some knowledge to start. Then use your intelligence to figure out the rest. Only take what you really want. Dump everything else from your mind. Figure out the rest. Its not that hard&hellip; You don&rsquo;t have to spend hours studying! You get the answers you want in an instant after your mind gets used to figuring things out on its own. Don&rsquo;t think your mind is dumb. Its more intelligent than you are. It know everything. Just let it teach you! In the war between Intelligence vs Knowledge, intelligence wins!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://YouAreCurious.github.io/images/post-images/2013/05/ancient-people-used-electricity.jpg" title="Ancient People Used Electricity?" alt="Ancient People Used Electricity?" /></p>

<p>We already know that our ancestors constructed great monuments that make us think &ldquo;How on earth did they do that?&rdquo;! How did they build massive structures like the great pyramid? How did they move large stones like the 800 ton <a href="http://atheism.about.com/od/religiousplaces/ig/Baalbek-Temples-Lebanon/Baalbek-Trilithon-Stone-Blocks.htm">Baalbek Trilithon</a> in Lebanon? How did they carve stones in high precision without a single crack? Did they had Alien help or did they used their own knowledge? Did our ancient people used electricity?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Lets take the Pyramids first. Some say these Pyramids were built long before the Egyptians for a different purpose. We can&rsquo;t prove this theory. We also don&rsquo;t have enough facts to deny this theory. We can&rsquo;t carbon date the Pyramids because they were built with stones. Archaeologists carbon date the mummies or other pieces within the stones that can be dated. But what if they were from repairs done to an existing structure? Normally, Pyramids contain hieroglyphs&hellip; Drawings made by the Egyptians to tell the story of the Pharaoh. But the archaeologists failed to find any drawing or inscription inside the great Pyramid of Giza. People believe it was built for the pharaoh named Kufu. Many Pyramids have been robbed by tomb robbers. But archaeologists found the great Pyramid intact. That mean they should have discovered a lot of artifacts and the mummy of Kufu. But surprisingly, they didn&rsquo;t find any mummy inside the Pyramid! Then why did the Egyptians build it?</p>

<p>In Baghdad Iraq, archaeologists have discovered an ancient battery. They call it the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad_Battery">Baghdad Battery</a>. They are terracotta pots containing a copper cylinder. Inside the copper cylinder, they found an iron rod. Some scientists say it can be a battery but some say its not. Still, there&rsquo;s no way to prove both the theories.</p>

<p>If the battery theory is correct, then we can say that our ancient people used electricity. Based on this theory, some people think the great Pyramid have been used as a power plant. According to the way the structure is built, the ancient astronaut theorists believe it can be used to generate electricity and distribute it through out the world using microwave energy! The theory is a bit far-fetched and hard to believe. But, check this video before continuing :</p>

<p><sub>&ndash; If you liked the video, you can buy the whole series from the <a href="http://shop.history.com/ancient-aliens/index.php?v=history_show_ancient-aliens">History Channel</a></sub></p>

<p><em>Before continuing, we need to clarify one thing in this video&hellip; They have mentioned about the mount Kailash as the birth place of Buddhism. I&rsquo;m a Buddhist and I have studied my religion well. I have never heard about this mountain. In pure Buddhism, there&rsquo;s no mention about that mountain!</em></p>

<p>Can you really believe the facts in that video? Did our ancient people used electricity? The Alien stuff can be hard to believe but what about the rest? The fact that our Ancient people used electricity and possessed technology to build these great monuments? Can we believe it? Still its hard because no one can prove them. Like our previous issues, in here also no one can prove them wrong.</p>

<p>However, we should know one thing&hellip; Our Ancestors were intelligent than us. We are less intelligent. What we have is knowledge. We take knowledge from the books and try to work according to them. But our ancestors thought clearly without any distractions. So, they were able to achieve great things. So, the fact that our ancient people used electricity can be true.</p>

<p>There are Aliens. It&rsquo;s selfish to think that we are all alone in this big universe. We are trying to find living beings like us. Who breathe oxygen and drink water&hellip; But can there be beings who breathe carbon dioxide and drink lava? Can be! In Earth, scientists are now discovering living beings in most extreme conditions. So, the fact that the aliens gave us the technology can be true. But don&rsquo;t bet on it too much!</p>

<h3>So, Did our ancient people used electricity?</h3>

<p>No matter what theory is right, still we can&rsquo;t understand how our ancient people lived. Did our ancient people used electricity? We don&rsquo;t know! Did they contact aliens? We don&rsquo;t know! We simply don&rsquo;t know&hellip; What we know is, they did great things that we still can&rsquo;t!</p>

    <link href="http://YouAreCurious.github.io/2013/04/yamato-largest-battleship/"/>
    <updated>2013-04-29T15:31:48+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://YouAreCurious.github.io/2013/04/yamato-largest-battleship</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://YouAreCurious.github.io/images/post-images/2013/04/yamato.jpg" title="Yamato" alt="Yamato" /></p>

<p>During the World War II, Japan launched a project to build the largest battle ship on earth! The project was top-secret. Even its designers didn&rsquo;t knew they are building the largest battle ship ever built. They also launched the ship in secret. In Yamato, they installed the most powerful weapons including large 18.1 inch main guns. It can shoot down ships even before they can come close enough to shoot back. So, why did it fail?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Do you know why I call it a &ldquo;Fail&rdquo;? Even the greatest ship can sink. Many great and useful ships have been taken down during the war. Most of them can&rsquo;t be called failures. But the problem with Yamato is, the Japanese navy never used it to take down ships. The thing it&rsquo;s designed for. It only acted as the flagship of the fleet. As a command vessel  It was launched only about a handful of times. Most of the times, it  was docked. The crew have named it the &ldquo;Hotel Yamato&rdquo;. The food is good, the place is good, they barely worked&hellip; It&rsquo;s a real hotel!</p>

<h3>Why didn&rsquo;t they use Yamato in battle?</h3>

<p>Why didn&rsquo;t the Japanese Navy used their most powerful battle ship during the war? The real truth is, Yamato is not practical. At that time, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_carriers">Aircraft Carriers</a> have become the super powers in sea. Japan know this very well. They used their fleet of carriers to attack the Pearl Harbor. But still, they laid plans for Yamato after about a week after this battle. They might have planned it even before the Pearl Harbor mission. If that mission worked according to the plans, Yamato might have ruled the sea. But the Pearl Harbor attack didn&rsquo;t went as they expected. They planed to take down the US aircraft carriers. But none were there during the attack!</p>

<p>In April 1945, when the US fleet closed in on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Okinawa">Okinawa</a>, Japan launched one desperate mission. They launched the Yamato and nine other battle ships to intercept the US fleet. Sadly, the US aircrafts took down Yamato easily. Its big. The largest battle ship&hellip; But the enemy possessed superior and practical weapons and tactics to match the ongoing war. So, Yamato sank with nearly 2,400 people on board!</p>

<h3>Lessons to learn from Yamato :</h3>

<p>The bigger they are, the harder they fall! We can learn a lot from Yamato. If you want a vehicle just for you to travel to your office, will you go for the biggest vehicle? Will you go for a big truck? A container? Will it be practical? It will be slow, hard to navigate through the traffic, hard to park! Will you go for it? Or will you go for a car? Think!</p>

<p>First of all, I’m a tech blogger and a web developer. I own <a href="http://techhamlet.com/">TechHamlet.com</a>. In the early days of my blogging, I only wanted to write about tech! Tutorials, tricks, software reviews, etc. Recently, I wanted to write something different. So I started Youarecurio.us. In the past few years I have used a lot of techniques to tune my life and be more productive. I also learnt a lot about living a happy life. It’s not hard… You just have to do some tweaking to the way you live. I learnt a lot about these tricks. Why not share them with every one?</p>
