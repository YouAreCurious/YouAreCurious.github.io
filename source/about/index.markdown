First of all, I’m a tech blogger and a web developer. I own <a href="http://techhamlet.com/" target="_blank">TechHamlet.com</a>. In the early days of my blogging, I only wanted to write about tech! Tutorials, tricks, software reviews, etc. Recently, I wanted to write something different. So I started Youarecurio.us. In the past few years I have used a lot of techniques to tune my life and be more productive. I also learnt a lot about living a happy life. It’s not hard… You just have to do some tweaking to the way you live. I learnt a lot about these tricks. Why not share them with every one?

Recently, I started to show an interest towards mystical scientific and historical facts. I want to know more about ancient and modern secrets… I’m curious… I want to find about the truth. I want to find about the ancient cultures, I want to find about the ancient aliens, I want to find about history’s greatest events… I’m just curious… I also like to learn about modern engineering. How did they build the largest plane on earth? How do they operate the biggest ship? How did they build such a big structure? I’m just curious…

Are you curious? I know Youarecurio.us! Have you ever tried to tune your life? Have you ever tried to dig through the world history? Have you ever tried to find about world’s secrets?
