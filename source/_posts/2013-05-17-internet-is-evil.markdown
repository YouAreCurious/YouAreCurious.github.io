The Internet is one of the greatest innovations that changed the world. It completely changed us. It have brought us closer. It have made our lives easier. It have brought almost all the knowledge in the world to our desk tops. It is really great. But, it also have a dark side... The Internet is Evil !

<!-- more -->

There are many great things that we use every day. We use them because they are useful to us. They help us. But remember, you can use the knife to prepare food and maintain your life... You can also use the same knife to end a life. Like that, the Internet also have a bad side. If you use it in the wrong way, for you, the Internet is Evil!


### You use the Internet to waste your time!


Many people around the world use Facebook and other social networks every day. They go there, chat, poke, send messages, share photos, etc, etc, etc... There are some crazy people who share every single thing they do in their lives on social networks. They share what they eat, when they eat, a photo of their lunch, where they go, what they do, what they think... Actually this is a big disease. A fatal disease which is even more dangerous than AIDS. After doing all these stuff, we won't have any time left to do other stuff. Parents ignore their children.. Children ignore their schoolwork... Workers ignore their work... Several years ago, I went for a job training. One day, the company hired a young man who seems to have some good talents. Unfortunately, he is a Facebook addict. He doesn't do his work in time... He always do a lot of mistakes... Every thing he do have a mistake... For him, Internet is Evil! Later the company decided to block Internet access to him. After several months, the guy resigned and took revenge by taking another worker with him and by hacking the company's email account! Cool isn't it? This is one situation where we can think that the Internet is Evil!


### The Internet is damaging your security! You have no privacy... Its like standing naked in the middle of a big crowd!


Do we really have to share every thing? If you have enemies, they can easily look at your Facebook profile and determine exactly how to bring you down. A thief can determine exactly when you leave your house and jump in. These stuff are true... Not just theories... These stuff happen. Because of this, once our local government issued warnings to the public not to share every thing online. Don't be foolish... The Internet is Evil!

Most of the big companies like Facebook and Google know a lot about you. They track your every move... You give them all your details... Do you think they will stay silent even when people like CIA and other big organizations offer money for your data? I don't think so. They publicly say that they share our information with their partners. Who are these partners? Can we trust them? Internet is Evil !


### Adults only sites make you brainless zombies!


According to research, this is the biggest threat that face man kind. After getting addicted to online porn, people get completely transformed. They start to get exhausted. Life drains out of them. Their brains start to malfunction. These are scientifically proven. It make you feel guilt, shame, and humiliated... Internet is Evil !



>-- Nearly all men who view pornography use it as the stimulus for masturbation. As a result they frequently suffer feelings of guilt, shame, regret and humiliation.
> 
	
>-- Many men become addicted to pornography and lose their freedom. They feel trapped, out of control, and in despair. They literally become slaves to their own lust.
> 
	
>-- Pornography places men on an emotional roller coaster. One minute they're happy, the next they're sad; calm, then angry; kind, then cold. These moods change without warning, causing stress and pain for wives, children, friends and associates. Feelings of estrangement ensue, further isolating and alienating them from their loved ones, which often drive men even deeper into the self-medicating escape of pornography.
> 
	
>-- Men isolated on the slippery slope of pornography typically fail in their families and marriages, and in their relations with people in general. They are less effective, less reliable, less creative, and more prone to meanness and fits of anger. In essence, pornography turns men into zombie-like characters who are but a shadow of their true selves and potential. They waste their time, talents and resources, caught up in their own dark little world of pornography viewing.
> 
	
>-- In the advanced stages, pornography addiction can lead a man to commit rape, incest, violence, exhibitionism, other sex-related crimes and even suicide. Millions of men have lost their families, their careers, their reputations, their good names, and their freedom just to satisfy their addiction.
> 
	
>-- Pornography can take an immensely good, talented, enthusiastic man and turn him into one of the walking dead.

Most people who are already addicted to these things might try to justify themselves. They might get extremely angry with me. But they will some day learn the truth. These things make you lose your humanity. The teenager don't know who is his parents... The workers don't know they have a job to do... Parents don't know they have children... Rape, Murder, Theft, Abuse and many more evil things rise because of these bad addictions. If you get to these things, you'll forget who you are. Trust me, the world will be a much better place if these pathetic psychos didn't start to show their stupidity by starting adult websites. It's a monster that take down our younger generation. There won't be anything left if we don't take an action now! The Internet is Evil!


### Too much information... You don't know what to believe and what not to believe...


Internet is a source of vast amount of information. But, how can we know whether they are true or false? Some say that even Wikipedia have a lot of false facts because they allow anyone to edit their pages. There are a large number of news websites. One story can be interpreted in many different ways in each website. How can we trust them? The truth is... We can't! The Internet is Evil!


### Its damaging your long-term memory... It make you think like another computer!


Normally, humans can't store something on their brains in an instant. It takes time for the information that enter our mind to settle in. But the Internet can make us distracted. That will prevent information from getting into our long-term memory. You can't always rely on Google to search things. What if Google goes down? What if you go somewhere which doesn't have Internet? What if you get lost in the wild? Can you use the internet to watch Man vs Wild and learn how to survive? I don't think so...






### Internet is Evil !!!


Face it... The Internet that you use every day is Evil! Most of you don't want to believe it but that's the truth. I only mentioned a small amount of facts that make it evil. There are a lot more. But that doesn't mean it's completely bad. It have a lot of uses. If used correctly, it can become a really useful companion to us. But the harsh truth is, most of the stupid people use it to ruin their lives! Its time to think! The Internet is Evil !
