During the World War II, Japan launched a project to build the largest battle ship on earth! The project was top-secret. Even its designers didn't knew they are building the largest battle ship ever built. They also launched the ship in secret. In Yamato, they installed the most powerful weapons including large 18.1 inch main guns. It can shoot down ships even before they can come close enough to shoot back. So, why did it fail?

Do you know why I call it a "Fail"? Even the greatest ship can sink. Many great and useful ships have been taken down during the war. Most of them can't be called failures. But the problem with Yamato is, the Japanese navy never used it to take down ships. The thing it's designed for. It only acted as the flagship of the fleet. As a command vessel  It was launched only about a handful of times. Most of the times, it  was docked. The crew have named it the "Hotel Yamato". The food is good, the place is good, they barely worked... It's a real hotel!


### Why didn't they use Yamato in battle?


Why didn't the Japanese Navy used their most powerful battle ship during the war? The real truth is, Yamato is not practical. At that time, [Aircraft Carriers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_carriers) have become the super powers in sea. Japan know this very well. They used their fleet of carriers to attack the Pearl Harbor. But still, they laid plans for Yamato after about a week after this battle. They might have planned it even before the Pearl Harbor mission. If that mission worked according to the plans, Yamato might have ruled the sea. But the Pearl Harbor attack didn't went as they expected. They planed to take down the US aircraft carriers. But none were there during the attack!

In April 1945, when the US fleet closed in on [Okinawa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Okinawa), Japan launched one desperate mission. They launched the Yamato and nine other battle ships to intercept the US fleet. Sadly, the US aircrafts took down Yamato easily. Its big. The largest battle ship... But the enemy possessed superior and practical weapons and tactics to match the ongoing war. So, Yamato sank with nearly 2,400 people on board!


### Lessons to learn from Yamato :


The bigger they are, the harder they fall! We can learn a lot from Yamato. If you want a vehicle just for you to travel to your office, will you go for the biggest vehicle? Will you go for a big truck? A container? Will it be practical? It will be slow, hard to navigate through the traffic, hard to park! Will you go for it? Or will you go for a car? Think!
