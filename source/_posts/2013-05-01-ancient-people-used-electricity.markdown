![Ancient People Used Electricity?](/images/post-images/2013/05/ancient-people-used-electricity.jpg "Ancient People Used Electricity?")

We already know that our ancestors constructed great monuments that make us think "How on earth did they do that?"! How did they build massive structures like the great pyramid? How did they move large stones like the 800 ton [Baalbek Trilithon](http://atheism.about.com/od/religiousplaces/ig/Baalbek-Temples-Lebanon/Baalbek-Trilithon-Stone-Blocks.htm) in Lebanon? How did they carve stones in high precision without a single crack? Did they had Alien help or did they used their own knowledge? Did our ancient people used electricity?

Lets take the Pyramids first. Some say these Pyramids were built long before the Egyptians for a different purpose. We can't prove this theory. We also don't have enough facts to deny this theory. We can't carbon date the Pyramids because they were built with stones. Archaeologists carbon date the mummies or other pieces within the stones that can be dated. But what if they were from repairs done to an existing structure? Normally, Pyramids contain hieroglyphs... Drawings made by the Egyptians to tell the story of the Pharaoh. But the archaeologists failed to find any drawing or inscription inside the great Pyramid of Giza. People believe it was built for the pharaoh named Kufu. Many Pyramids have been robbed by tomb robbers. But archaeologists found the great Pyramid intact. That mean they should have discovered a lot of artifacts and the mummy of Kufu. But surprisingly, they didn't find any mummy inside the Pyramid! Then why did the Egyptians build it?

In Baghdad Iraq, archaeologists have discovered an ancient battery. They call it the [Baghdad Battery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad_Battery). They are terracotta pots containing a copper cylinder. Inside the copper cylinder, they found an iron rod. Some scientists say it can be a battery but some say its not. Still, there's no way to prove both the theories.

If the battery theory is correct, then we can say that our ancient people used electricity. Based on this theory, some people think the great Pyramid have been used as a power plant. According to the way the structure is built, the ancient astronaut theorists believe it can be used to generate electricity and distribute it through out the world using microwave energy! The theory is a bit far-fetched and hard to believe. But, check this video before continuing :

_Before continuing, we need to clarify one thing in this video... They have mentioned about the mount Kailash as the birth place of Buddhism. I'm a Buddhist and I have studied my religion well. I have never heard about this mountain. In pure Buddhism, there's no mention about that mountain!_

Can you really believe the facts in that video? Did our ancient people used electricity? The Alien stuff can be hard to believe but what about the rest? The fact that our Ancient people used electricity and possessed technology to build these great monuments? Can we believe it? Still its hard because no one can prove them. Like our previous issues, in here also no one can prove them wrong.

However, we should know one thing... Our Ancestors were intelligent than us. We are less intelligent. What we have is knowledge. We take knowledge from the books and try to work according to them. But our ancestors thought clearly without any distractions. So, they were able to achieve great things. So, the fact that our ancient people used electricity can be true.

There are Aliens. It's selfish to think that we are all alone in this big universe. We are trying to find living beings like us. Who breathe oxygen and drink water... But can there be beings who breathe carbon dioxide and drink lava? Can be! In Earth, scientists are now discovering living beings in most extreme conditions. So, the fact that the aliens gave us the technology can be true. But don't bet on it too much!


### So, Did our ancient people used electricity?


No matter what theory is right, still we can't understand how our ancient people lived. Did our ancient people used electricity? We don't know! Did they contact aliens? We don't know! We simply don't know... What we know is, they did great things that we still can't!
