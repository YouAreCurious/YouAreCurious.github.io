![Hitler](/images/post-images/2013/06/hitler.jpg "Hitler")

Before starting to study history, I knew very little about Hitler. I knew him as the vicious savage man who killed millions of people! Why did he started the war? Is it just because he is mad? He said he and the other pure Germans are the most superior race on this planet! Is it true? Lets find out...

### Hitler is not a German and his race is unknown!

This will be a real blow to most of you. Yes... Its true... Hitler is not a German! He was born in [Austria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria). Very close to the German border. Hitler killed because of a racial problem. He wanted to eliminate the Jews. But Hitler's own race is unknown. No one know whether he belong to a good race or to Jews. It was a very closely guarded secret!

### Why did he started the war?

First, Hitler was just a courier for the German army. During the 1<sup>st</sup> World War, he saw the carnage first hand. The Allies hit Germany very hard. In this hard time, the Jews have refused to help them! The role played by the Jews is a bit unclear at this moment. Some say they were innocent and some say they are the cause. People say that, because Jews doesn't have their own country, they lived in other nations. But they were not patriotic. They never help the country they live in. If you check the history, many wars started due to these Jews. Its still unclear to me why they are so hated. Hitler also hated them for not supporting his country. So he thought of getting rid of them!

After the World War I, the Allies enforced harsh rules against Germany. The country became one of the poorest nations on earth. Hitler wanted to change this. World War I completely changed him. Actually, the World War I created Hitler! If the records are correct, he fought for his own people! To save his own nation. But he did it the wrong way.

### Hitler called himself an Aryan!

Hitler said he belongs to the Aryan race. But the truth is, Aryans lived in India. Its a noble pure race. Lord Buddha is an Aryan. Lord Buddha later called people who follow his religion are Aryans. Not as a race, just a name. (But the Buddha completely denied the races. He told us that everyone is equal.). But now we know that even Hitler didn't knew his real race!

### Hitler said he and his followers belong to a superior race! Are they that superior?

In here we should first note that before Hitler, Germany was a poor country which had a very small military force. Most of its military powers were removed after the 1<sup>st</sup> World War. Hitler somehow made this nation into one of the most powerful nations on earth! He did bring glory for his own people. Many mainstream technologies that we use today were invented by Hitler's scientists. His scientists invented the first jet engine. His scientists invented the first ballistic missile. His scientists cracked the secrets of nuclear energy! They are genius!

Hitler did a lot of stuff for his nation. But still, he did it in the wrong way. He killed millions of people without any hesitation. He was a brutal killer. The whole world know that. But I don't think most of you knew the stuff I talked today. There are more secrets in his life which need to be uncovered. I will surely let you know when I learn more about him. So, [stay in touch](http://eepurl.com/yH0mv)!
